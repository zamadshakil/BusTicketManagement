# Bus Ticket Management System

This is a simple **Bus Ticket Management System** implemented in C++ as a console-based application. The project demonstrates the use of fundamental programming concepts such as loops, `if-else` conditions, switch cases, arrays, and dynamic data structures like `std::vector`.

## **Project Description**

The Bus Ticket Management System is designed to:
- Store and manage bus routes along with their travel times and ticket prices.
- Allow users to dynamically add or remove routes.
- Provide features such as displaying available routes, booking tickets, and calculating total costs.

This project is developed as part of a programming assignment to apply basic C++ concepts and create a practical solution.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Route Management**:
  - Add new routes.
  - Remove existing routes.
  - Display available routes with travel times and prices.

- **Ticket Booking**:
  - Select a route to book a ticket.
  - Calculate and display the total price for a given number of passengers.

- **Data Storage**:
  - Routes, travel times, and prices are stored dynamically using `std::vector` and `struct`.
